## Building and Implementing a Deep Learning Speech Classifier in Python

We will lightly cover the background of sound/speech and neural networks such as convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory networks. Our main goal, however, is to get a hold of speech data, prepare it for training, train models, and finally to test the models on new speech. I want participants to be introduced to the whole process. 

While some of the code is quite complex, **this workshop is meant for everyone**. If you are new to Python, we will walk through the code together and there will be people there to help! You will walk away with new Python tricks and a perspective into fun projects using Python so please don't shy away.

## Requirements

For full-participation in the workshop, the following is needed:

* CPU computer with enough memory to download appx 150Mb of data

* computer with recording capabilities (ideally via headphones)

* installations of necessary packages, e.g. keras, tensorflow, etc. found <a href="https://github.com/a-n-rose/workshops/blob/master/deep_learning_acoustics/README.md">here</a>, under the section "Prerequisites"

### Ideally completed before coming:

* read through my <a href="https://a-n-rose.github.io/2019/01/13/workshop-pyladies-deeplearning-speech.html">blog post</a> (I will update this up until early February)

* downloaded the speech data (female and male speech). Instructions can be found <a href="https://github.com/a-n-rose/workshops/blob/master/deep_learning_acoustics/README.md">here</a>, under the section "Download the Data"

## Don't have "Requirements"?

The workshop can be useful even to those who don't fully participate. For example, part of the workshop focuses on implementing useful Python code in functions, independent of the entire proect. So come anyways and don't worry about it! 

I look forward to this workshop and if you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me.

Best,
